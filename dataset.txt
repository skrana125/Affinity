Q. Which is an interesting data set you discovered recently? 
    Why is it your favorite? No datasets on Kaggle, please.

Ans :- There is lots of dataset is available but I think I found climent change data is interesting
        because there is listing the CO2 level globally and also CO2 emission from fossile fuel by different
        nations. like we always talk about USA and China but there level of producing CO2 is increasing
        on daily basis and even not in little amount it is huge despite of that they talk about climet 
        change and saving enviroment thing that really odd to me that that who talk lot about saving enviroment
        are causing the enviroment damange.

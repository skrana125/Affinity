Q. This question is to test your aptitude for writing small shell scripts on Unix. 
   You are given this URL amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt. 
   Write a shell script that extracts the Scheme Name and Asset Value fields only and saves them in a csv file.

Ans - #!/bin/bash

    # Download the file from the URL and save it as NAVAll.txt
    wget amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt -O NAVAll.txt

    # Extract Scheme Name and Asset Value fields and save them in output.csv
    cat NAVAll.txt | awk -F ';' '{print $4 "," $5}' > output.csv

    # Print success message
    echo "Scheme Name and Asset Value fields extracted and saved in output.csv"
